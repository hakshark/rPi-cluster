# rPi-cluster

This repo is to be used to support my learning process of building a multi-node Raspberry pi cluster.

The goal is to build a 5 node (1 master/4 worker) cluster and running a series of containers.

SoftTech will be:
-	O/S - Raspberry Pi o/s 64-bit
-	Docker - in a swarm configuration
-	Portainer - GUI Container Management Utility
