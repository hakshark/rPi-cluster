# rPi-cluster

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hakshark/rPi-cluster/images/raspberry-pi-logo.jpg" height="73" alt="Raspberry Pi Logo" /></p>

This repo is to be used to support my learning process of building a multi-node Raspberry pi cluster.
The cluster can then be setup with various containers allowing me to learn how to install, configure and use a range of applications.

The goal is to build a 5 node (1 master/4 worker) cluster and running a series of containers.

SoftTech will be:
-	O/S - Raspberry Pi o/s 64-bit (Bullseye lite)
-	Docker - in a swarm configuration
-	Portainer - GUI Container Management Utility
-	I will add any extra packages and utilities I use along the way
